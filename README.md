# Nexmind Website

## Project Graduation

<br />

<p>Single page Website realised for Nexmind</p>

<p>The main purpose was to give a brand new design to the older Nexmind website, without adding additionnal content, and
keeping it the simpliest possible. </p>

<p>This version is the latest version gave to the client before my examination, the current one has received small improvements and changes in the base code (the design remains untouched)</p>

<p>The project includes mostly HTML - SCSS and Jquery code. Animations have been realised with Green socks solutions. The Vue file and his code have been removed in the final version.</p>

<p>This Website and his application were done after the realisation of a Strategic Analysis. You can take a look on it at this adress : </p>
